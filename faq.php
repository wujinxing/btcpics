<h2 id="album">How do I put my pictures in one album?</h2>
<p>When uploading a picture think of a random album ID (for example <em>HS81kdaf5sDAjj8dasfT5</em> - don't use this one!) and enter it in the corresponding field. Use the same album ID for every picture you want to be in one album. This will put a link next to your pictures were visitor can find all other picture from this album.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you don't forget your album ID</strong> and don't share it with others if you don't want them to put pictures in your album. But you can share your album link with others so they can view all your pictures. With the album link they won't be able to put pictures in your album.</p>
